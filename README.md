## The Lectures
In order to view the lectures and run experiments you will need to have python 3+ and jupyter notebooks installed on your machine. If you do not have these already I suggest you [Download Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html) which has both of these and many other useful python packages already in it.

To view a lecture you will boot jupyter notebooks and browse to the lecture folder and open it. Then you can see the lecture content and begin learning about K-Nearest Neighbors. Make sure to view the student version of each lecture so you don't see the solutions before you begin an exercise.
