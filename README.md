# MachineLearningCourse
An introduction to machine learning course with a focus on the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. Developed by James Bocinsky.

## The Lectures
In order to view the lectures and run experiments you will need to have python 3+ and jupyter notebooks. If you do not have these already I suggest you [download anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html) which has both of these already in it.

To view a lecture you will boot jupyter notebooks and browse to the lecture folder and open it. Then you can see the lecture content.
